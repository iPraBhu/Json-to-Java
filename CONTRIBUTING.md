# Contributing to json-to-pojo

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Development workflow
1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Create a feature branch from `main`.
4. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run test` before committing.
5. Submit a pull request describing the motivation and screenshots when UI changes are involved.

## Commit conventions
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.
- Reference related issues where possible (`Fixes #123`).
- Use present tense and explain the *why* when the change is not obvious.

## Pull requests
- Include tests for new functionality and bug fixes.
- Update documentation when behavior or configuration changes.
- Ensure the app builds (`npm run build`) and all GitHub Actions checks pass.

## Questions or help
Open a discussion or issue if you need help with the setup or would like feedback on an idea before implementation.
